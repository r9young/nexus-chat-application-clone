import { getServerSession } from 'next-auth';
// getServerSession is a NextAuth helper that retrieves the current user session on the server.
import { authOptions } from '../api/auth/[...nextauth]/route';


export default async function getSession() {
  const session = await getServerSession(authOptions);

}


// You are asking me if it's correct to say that the code uses the `getServerSession` function from the `next-auth` library to get information defined by `authOptions`.

// Yes, that's a clear and accurate way to express it.

// ### Clearly rephrased:

// **"The code uses the `getServerSession` method provided by the `next-auth` library, and passes `authOptions` as its parameter to retrieve the current user's authentication information."**

// ### More explicitly:

// * `getServerSession` is a function from `next-auth` that fetches the session details.
// * `authOptions` describes how NextAuth authenticates users and what session data it provides.

// Combining them lets you retrieve details of the currently authenticated user in your application.
