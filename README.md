### Content of the Branch

You are asking me to confirm your approach to clearly building this component setup:

* You’ll start from the **lowest-level component** (`MessageBox`).
* You’ll clearly define your **data type (`FullMessageType`)**.
* Then, I will provide you with a clear, concrete sample based on your provided data structure.
* Finally, you’ll use this visualization to clearly structure your data inside your component.

**Yes, your approach is correct!**
The key points are indeed to:

1. **Clearly define and understand your data structure.**
2. **Visualize clearly how this data will look in actual usage.**
3. **Code clearly using that data structure.**

### ✅ **Your clearly outlined approach:**

**Step 1:**
Define your data type clearly (you provide `FullMessageType`).

**Step 2 (My Job):**
I will create a realistic sample dataset clearly matching your data structure.

**Step 3:**
You will visualize the sample clearly, and then use it to structure your `MessageBox` component code.
