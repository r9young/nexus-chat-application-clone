current I am working on the SettingModal/Input

try to understand how to use Input and UseForm hook

https://github.com/r9young/nexus-chat-application-clone/issues/56

we are working on the issue 56 and 58


### 28/06/2025

We have read the Issue 56 - SettingModal/Input

Then we develop a Issue[#58](https://github.com/r9young/nexus-chat-application-clone/issues/58) - understanding the useForm hook

and further, we developed issues#59 how to use the useForm hook


The useForm hook returns an object containing methods and state values that help manage form behavior. You can specify a preset type (FieldValues or a custom interface) to allow any shape of form inputs. It also accepts defaultValues to prefill the form fields.

Since the object returned from useForm is immediately destructured, you can directly use its output—like register, handleSubmit, watch, etc.—in the body and return section of the component without referencing the full object again.
